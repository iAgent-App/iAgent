  # iAgent
 
## Overview

### Description
A "LinkedIn for athletes", this app allows athletes to connect with prospective schools/teams/agents and vice versa. Users are able to showcase their abilities and stats in order to make useful connections.  

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking / Sports / Position Finder
- **Mobile:** Is initially being built as a mobile app for I-phone users. Eventually it could be built for Andriod users as well as for other devices (mobile or otherwise). 
- **Story:** Allows user to create profiles to connect with others in the world of sports. The app functions similar to a personal agent to help user's build their network for opportunities.
- **Market:** Athletes who want to play at the next level, whether it be collegiately or professionally. Organizations, schools, coaches and scouts would all be able to utilize this app to expand the athletes' network.
- **Habit:** Could be used as often as the user has something to highlight, or as often as they want to network with others.
- **Scope:** Starting with allowing the user to create a profile that markets themself to other users. Eventually we could implement the feed. In the future it might be beneficial if this is a one--stop app for teams as well (maybe implmenting a team version that allows schedules to be added so connections know when/where to see their connections play). Potential partnership with LinkedIn - could make "LinkedIn but for Athletes" our motto.
- **Selling point:** Easy way for athletes to expand their sports network.
- **Monetization:** Subscription where user gets addiitional functionality (i.e. Who has viewed their profile)
